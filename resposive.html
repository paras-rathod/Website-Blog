Throughout this course we're going to learn HTML and CSS by building out the One Million Lines site. In the
process of making the site you will learn everything you need to know about HTML and CSS so that you can
create any site you want.
I think you are going to be surprised at how easy it is to build great looking sites fast and hopefully you have
flashes of feeling like you have a new super power.</p></content>
